The files under this directory are compiled from the [Kaitai Struct](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html)
binary description language into a Javascript Parser.

You should be able to use these definitions as-is to compile
them to a number of different languages.

These definitions are different slightly from the ones in their Format Gallery
in that they will contain detailed parsing of symbol tables, and other
interesting things for security analysis.
